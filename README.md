This is a small Java console app that simulates a hotel reservation system: you can create rooms and users, book rooms between two dates, check availability, validate dates, and update user balances. Everything is stored in memory using `ArrayList` inside the `Service` class, and `Main` runs the exact scenario from the test (creating rooms/users, trying several bookings, then printing all rooms, bookings and users).
for your question I will seperate services for each entity 
for the second question I added a LocalDate and called the method now so the booking get impacted when we call setRoom or bookRoom or setUser so th actual booking changes (snapshot the method findRoomById, actually we can inspect booking using the id of the room and what I actually did is snapshot (I injected room and user in booking so booking store the actual room and when i call setRoom the room linked to that booking changes so the only problem is when we call the room or the user of that specific booking to get an attribut I didnt full snapshot the state can change later.
I should add snapshot fields (room type, room price, user balance at booking) into Booking and use those when printing, instead of reading from the live room and user objects but I should inject a lot of parameters in my methods and attributs in the booking entity. here is the output of my project.
